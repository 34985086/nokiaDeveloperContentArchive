Hello,

I have a professionnal software to create that musn't ask the user for a Bluetooth PIN code. I have an electronical device with BT 4.0 and on my Windows 7 computer a BT 4.0 dongle.

As I can't find information about simple pairing (Bluetooth 2.1) support of QBluetooth for Windows, can you please tell me if it is ok ?

Kind regards

Bernard
