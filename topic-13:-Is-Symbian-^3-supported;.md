Hello, as the title says, does the library works fine under Symbian !^3?

I haven't any Symbian !^3 device so it would be great if any of you could confirm it works (or not).

Thanks!

I use it on a Nokia N8, and it works fine. I haven't used all library features, though.

Symbian !^3 SDK is still beta, so it's a good idea to be cautious when using the library. Some of the tests I did was compiling for 5th Edition, and it worked fine on the N8.
