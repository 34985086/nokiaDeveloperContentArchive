Hi,

I'm trying to discover remote devices with the QBluetooth library.

The discovery seems to work because the remote devices are found. The problem is that although the signal discoveryStopped() is emitted, the object QBtDeviceDiscoverer is always busy to discovering ....

Can somebody help me?

Thanks!
