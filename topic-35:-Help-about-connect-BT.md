There is some signal or some way of knowing when my mobile phone connects to a bluetooth (eg car bluetooth)?

Thanks

Hello.

There are signals doing what you want but only if your are the one who initiates the connection.

But from what i understand, that's not the case you are looking for. You want to get signals for bluetooth event's that take place outside of your application, right?

I am not sure if this is even possible, but i am almost sure that it can't be done from this library.

Yes, I want a sign to tell me when my mobile phone connecting to the bluetooth car. The application must detect this connection, which is made ??out of the application.

Thanks anyway for your help.

Greetings.
