Hello,

  I'm using the library QBluetooth. When attempting to install file
QBluetooth_selfsigned.sisx would not let me, so I sign my
certificate to my phone. After signing left me install it.

  I'm creating a simple program to search for devices
has bluetooth. In this program you get the permissions:

   LocalServices NetworkServices ReadUserData UserEnviroment WriteUserData

  And I sign my certificate. When installed, it installs
correctly, but when I will not let me run and run
security reasons.

  I'm quite desperate about 3 months trying to solve the
problem reading forums but never get it.

  I just want a little program to search for Bluetooth devices and
if it finds one that is defined in the phone, then starts another
of software. Already doing everything but what I have bluetooth too
discouraged.

  Please, someone to guide me how to do it and let me
run.

  I'm using Qt for the Nokia SDK. I am trying it on my phone n95
8GB.
